  abstract = {In virtual environments, terrain is generally modeled by heightield,
	a 2D structure. To be able to create desired terrain geometry, software
	editors for this specific task have been developed. The graphics
	hardware, data structures and rendering techniques are developing
	fast to open up new possibilities to the user and terrain editor
	functionalities are following such improvements (such as real-time
	lighting updates during editing operations and multi-texture blending).
	Yet, current terrain editors mostly fail to give the user feedback
	about their actions and also fail to help the users understand and
	undo the editing operations on the terrain. The aim of this study
	is to investigate the 3d-widget based visualization of possible editing
	(sculpturing) actions on terrain and to help user undo previous operations.}
